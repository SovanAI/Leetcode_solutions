#     Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.

# The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

# Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (" ").
# Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity if neither present.
# Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
# Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.
# Return the integer as the final result.
